{{< theme_text_color >}}YMO{{< /theme_text_color >}}'s album "Solid State Survivor" had a massive influence on synth-pop and electronic music in general and is considered brilliant for several reasons.

First off, the album showcased a groundbreaking fusion of electronic music with pop sensibilities. It was way ahead of its time, blending synthesizers and digital sounds with catchy melodies and funky rhythms. You can definitely hear their influence in the early video games soundtracks (The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros, Final Fantasy, Streets of Rage, to name just a few) but also in animes, like [Dragon Ball Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm77VCkf_do) (this is a litteral reference to this album).

The album's tracks are incredibly well-crafted, with meticulous attention to detail. Songs like {{< theme_text_color >}}"Technopolis"{{< /theme_text_color >}} and {{< theme_text_color >}}"Rydeen"{{< /theme_text_color >}} are perfect examples of how YMO could create intricate, layered compositions that still felt accessible and danceable. The use of technology in their music was revolutionary, pushing the boundaries of what electronic instruments could do and setting new standards for music production.
