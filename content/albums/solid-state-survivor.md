{{< theme_text_color >}}YMO{{< /theme_text_color >}}'s album "Solid State Survivor" had a massive influence on synth-pop and electronic music in general and is considered brilliant for many reasons.

This album's tracks are incredibly well-crafted, with songs like {{< theme_text_color >}}"Technopolis"{{< /theme_text_color >}} and {{< theme_text_color >}}"Rydeen"{{< /theme_text_color >}} that are perfect examples of how YMO could create intricate, layered compositions that still felt accessible and danceable.  
It was way ahead of its time, blending synthesizers and digital sounds with catchy melodies and funky rhythms. You can definitely hear their influence in the early video games soundtracks ([Super Locomotive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJfNDdsMcC4), Mega Man, [Touhou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No6uEomo8VQ), Streets of Rage, to name just a few) but also in animes, like [Dragon Ball Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm77VCkf_do) (this is a litteral reference to this album).
