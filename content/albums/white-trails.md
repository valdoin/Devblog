{{< theme_text_color >}}Chris Rainbow’s{{< /theme_text_color >}} White Trails is a hidden gem of late '70s pop rock. The album feels like a warm breeze, effortlessly catchy yet intricately arranged.

Of all the tracks, I found myself coming back to {{< theme_text_color >}}"Don't Take the Night Away"{{< /theme_text_color >}} the most. There’s something special about the way it balances a dreamy atmosphere with an infectious chorus. The silky vocals and delicate instrumental build-up make it feel both intimate and cinematic, like a song meant for a moonlit drive.
