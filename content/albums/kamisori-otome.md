I could recommend {{< theme_text_color >}}Ichiko Aoba{{< /theme_text_color >}}'s entire discography, but I'll focus on the album that first introduced me to her music.  
It's her debut album, establishing the foundation of her musical style : a fragile, almost angelic voice with etheral guitar works.   
There's nothing overproduced, her music breathes and leaves room for silence.
