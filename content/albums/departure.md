There's a unique kind of magic in this {{< theme_text_color >}}Nujabes{{< /theme_text_color >}}' album that makes it an unforgettable listening experience.  
Made famous by the anime {{< theme_text_color >}}Samurai Champloo{{< /theme_text_color >}}, they both share an aesthetic that bridges different worlds.  
{{< theme_text_color >}}Departure{{< /theme_text_color >}} is a soulful journey through a landscape of hip-hop chill beats and smooth jazz melodies, while {{< theme_text_color >}}Samurai Champloo{{< /theme_text_color >}} blends chanbara and Edo period with modern hip-hop culture.  
Like all of {{< theme_text_color >}}Nujabes{{< /theme_text_color >}}' work, this album is an absolute goldmine for sample diggers and you should definitely consider checking it out.  

*BTW : Ichiko Aoba paid a beautiful tribute to Nujabes' legacy by [covering 'aruariance dance'](https://soundcloud.com/devitalila/sweet-william-ft-ichiko-aoba) alongside Sweet William.(see my [article](https://valdoin-blog.olivierandriko.com/albums/kamisori-otome/) on Ichiko Aoba)*
